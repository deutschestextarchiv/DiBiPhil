# DiBiPhil Corpus

The DiBiPhil Corpus was curated by the Historical Corpora working group 
at the Centre of Language at Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and 
Humanities (BBAW). Curation was possible due to BMBF funding for the projects
CLARIAH-DE and ZDL. The texts curated here were originally provided by 
Directmedia Publishing within the "Digital Library" on Zeno.org. 
For the DiBiPhil Corpus texts were homogenized and transferred into the 
TEI format [DTABf](https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/doku/basisformat)
as well as extensively enriched with (bibliographical) metadata. They are
now made accessible within the DTA infrastructure where they may be 
researched using the DDC search engine integrated in the DTA as well
as other DTA tools for linguistic analysis.

## Coverage

The texts of the DiBiPhil Corpus date back to the 15th to 20th century
with a clear focus on 18th to 20th cent. literature. The corpus
includes scholarly as well as literary texts with philosophical contents 
or background written by renowned authors.
